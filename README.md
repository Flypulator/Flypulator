# Flypulator Project
## About Us
Aim of the Flypulator project is the development of flight robots for manipulation of stationary objects. Possible application scenarios include cleaning tasks and vegetation trimming in hardly accessible places. The development is focused on fully actuated flight robots. Due to their high agility, they allow the use of lightweight manipulators with small degree of freedom. The most important fields of activity are the construction of the hardware, the development and implementation of the control system and a detailed modelling including aerodynamical simulations and experiments.
